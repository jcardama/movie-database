### The Motivation behind the app: ###
During the work on this app, my goal was put in practice the knowledge I've acquired to make better Android apps takling the some relatively new subjects.

Some of those subjects include:
- The Kotlin programming language
- Clean architecture
- Dagger2
- Android architecture components (ViewModels, LiveData, Room, etc.)

### How to run the app: ###
This app uses [The MovieDB public API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
Register (its free) and grab your API key, 
then paste it inside: `.../core/Config.kt`
